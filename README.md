# Libft - 42 School Project 🚀

Welcome to **my libft**, a C library developed as part of the 42 project. This project reimplements several standard C library functions to better understand the fundamentals of programming and memory management without relying on external libraries. 🎉

## Key Features ✨

My libft includes a set of functions for manipulating strings, managing memory, and performing data conversions. Here's an overview of the available features:

### String Manipulation 📝
- **`ft_strlen`** - Calculates the length of a string.
- **`ft_strdup`** - Duplicates a string.
- **`ft_strchr`** - Searches for the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- **`ft_strrchr`** - Searches for the last occurrence of a character in a string.
- **`ft_strnstr`** - Searches for the first occurrence of a substring in a string up to a specified length.
- **`ft_strlcpy`** - Copies up to a specified number of characters from one string to another.
- **`ft_strlcat`** - Appends a string to another with a size limit.
- **`ft_strncmp`** - Compares two strings up to a specified length.
- **`ft_strmapi`** - Applies a function to each character of a string and returns the resulting string.
- **`ft_striteri`** - Applies a function to each character of a string, modifying it in-place.

### Memory Management 💾
- **`ft_memset`** - Fills a memory area with a specified value.
- **`ft_memcpy`** - Copies one memory area to another.
- **`ft_memmove`** - Moves memory areas, handling overlaps.
- **`ft_bzero`** - Fills a memory area with zeros.
- **`ft_memchr`** - Searches for a value in a memory area.
- **`ft_memcmp`** - Compares two memory areas.
- **`ft_calloc`** - Allocates memory for an array and initializes it to zero.

### Data Conversion 🔄
- **`ft_atoi`** - Converts a string to an integer.
- **`ft_itoa`** - Converts an integer to a string.

### Utility Functions 🔧
- **`ft_isdigit`** - Checks if a character is a digit.
- **`ft_isalpha`** - Checks if a character is an alphabetic letter.
- **`ft_isalnum`** - Checks if a character is alphanumeric.
- **`ft_isascii`** - Checks if a character is an ASCII character.
- **`ft_isprint`** - Checks if a character is printable.
- **`ft_toupper`** - Converts a lowercase letter to uppercase.
- **`ft_tolower`** - Converts an uppercase letter to lowercase.
- **`ft_strjoin`** - Joins two strings into one.
- **`ft_strtrim`** - Trims the characters at the beginning and end of a string.
- **`ft_substr`** - Extracts a substring from a string.
- **`ft_split`** - Splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.

## Project Goals 🎯

The goals of this project are to:
- Reimplement standard C library functions.
- Understand memory management in C.
- Follow the 42 coding standard and improve C programming skills.
- Optimize functions for efficiency.

## Contributing 🤝
