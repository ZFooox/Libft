# Libft - 42 School Project 🚀

Welcome to **my libft**, a C library developed as part of the 19 project. This project reimplements several standard C library functions to better understand the fundamentals of programming and memory management without relying on external libraries. 🎉

## Key Features ✨

My libft includes a set of functions for manipulating strings, managing memory, and performing data conversions. Here's an overview of the available features:

### String Manipulation 📝
- **`ft_strlen`** - Calculates the length of a string.
- **`ft_strcpy`** - Copies a string from source to destination.
- **`ft_strcat`** - Concatenates two strings.
- **`ft_strlcat`** - Concatenates with a size limit on the resulting string.
- **`ft_strdup`** - Duplicates a string.

### Memory Management 💾
- **`ft_memset`** - Fills a memory area with a specified value.
- **`ft_memcpy`** - Copies one memory area to another.
- **`ft_memmove`** - Moves memory areas, handling overlaps.
- **`ft_bzero`** - Fills a memory area with zeros.

### Data Conversion 🔄
- **`ft_atoi`** - Converts a string to an integer.
- **`ft_itoa`** - Converts an integer to a string.

### Utility Functions 🔧
- **`ft_isdigit`**, **`ft_isalpha`**, **`ft_isalnum`** - Checks the type of a character (e.g., whether it's a digit, letter, etc.)
- **`ft_strchr`**, **`ft_strrchr`** - Searches for a character in a string.

## Project Goals 🎯

The goals of this project are to:
- Reimplement standard C library functions from the man.
- Understand memory management in C.
- Follow the 19 coding standard and improve C programming skills.
- Optimize functions for efficiency.

## Contributing 🤝

If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to create a **pull request**. All contributions are welcome! 🎉

And I know I still have to protect the pointers !
